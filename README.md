# Prometheus metric library for Nginx

This is a Lua library that can be used with Nginx to keep track of metrics and
expose them on a separate web page to be pulled by
[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io).

## Installation

To use this library, you will need the [ngx_lua](
https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module) nginx module. You can either use
a lua-enabled nginx-based server like [OpenResty](https://openresty.org/en/),
or a regular nginx server with the module enabled: for example, on Debian 10 you
can simply install `libnginx-mod-http-lua` (but please read the [known issues](
#known-issues) if you use a later Debian version).

The library file - `prometheus.lua` - needs to be available in `LUA_PATH`. If
this is the only Lua library you use, you can just point `lua_package_path` to
the directory with this git repo checked out (see example below).

OpenResty users will find this library in [opm](https://opm.openresty.org/package/knyar/nginx-lua-prometheus/). It
is also available via
[luarocks](https://luarocks.org/modules/knyar/nginx-lua-prometheus).

## Quick start guide

To track request latency broken down by server name and request count
broken down by server name and status, add the following to the `http` section
of `nginx.conf`:

```nginx
lua_shared_dict prometheus_metrics 10M;
lua_package_path "/path/to/nginx-lua-prometheus/?.lua;;";

init_worker_by_lua_block {
  prometheus = require("prometheus").init("prometheus_metrics")

  metric_requests = prometheus:counter(
    "nginx_http_requests_total", "Number of HTTP requests", {"host", "status"})
  metric_latency = prometheus:histogram(
    "nginx_http_request_duration_seconds", "HTTP request latency", {"host"})
  metric_connections = prometheus:gauge(
    "nginx_http_connections", "Number of HTTP connections", {"state"})
}

log_by_lua_block {
  metric_requests:inc(1, {ngx.var.server_name, ngx.var.status})
  metric_latency:observe(tonumber(ngx.var.request_time), {ngx.var.server_name})
}
```

This:
* configures a shared dictionary for your metrics called `prometheus_metrics`
  with a 10MB size limit;
* registers a counter called `nginx_http_requests_total` with two labels:
  `host` and `status`;
* registers a histogram called `nginx_http_request_duration_seconds` with one
  label `host`;
* registers a gauge called `nginx_http_connections` with one label `state`;
* on each HTTP request measures its latency, recording it in the histogram and
  increments the counter, setting current server name as the `host` label and
  HTTP status code as the `status` label.

Last step is to configure a separate server that will expose the metrics.
Please make sure to only make it reachable from your Prometheus server:

```nginx
server {
  listen 9145;
  allow 192.168.0.0/16;
  deny all;
  location /metrics {
    content_by_lua_block {
      metric_connections:set(ngx.var.connections_reading, {"reading"})
      metric_connections:set(ngx.var.connections_waiting, {"waiting"})
      metric_connections:set(ngx.var.connections_writing, {"writing"})
      prometheus:collect()
    }
  }
}
```

Metrics will be available at `http://your.nginx:9145/metrics`. Note that the
gauge metric in this example contains values obtained from nginx global state,
so they get set immediately before metrics are returned to the client.

## API reference

### init()

**syntax:** require("prometheus").init(*dict_name*, [*options*]])

Initializes the module. This should be called once from the
[init_worker_by_lua_block](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#init_worker_by_lua_block)
section of nginx configuration.

* `dict_name` is the name of the nginx shared dictionary which will be used to
  store all metrics. Defaults to `prometheus_metrics` if not specified.
* `options` is a table of configuration options that can be provided. Accepted
  options are:
  * `prefix` (string): metric name prefix. This string will be prepended to
    metric names on output.
  * `error_metric_name` (string): Can be used to change the default name of
    error metric (see [Built-in metrics](#built-in-metrics) for details).
  * `sync_interval` (number): sets the sync interval for per-worker counters and
    key index (in seconds). This sets the boundary on eventual consistency of
    counter metric increments, and metric resets/deletions. Defaults to 1.
  * `lookup_max_size` (number): maximum size of a per-metric lookup table
    maintained by each worker to cache full metric names. Defaults to 1000.
    If you have metrics with extremely high cardinality and lots of available
    RAM, you might want to increase this to avoid cache getting flushed too
    often. Decreasing this makes sense if you have a very large number of
    metrics or need to minimize memory usage of this library.

Returns a `prometheus` object that should be used to register metrics.

Example:
```nginx
init_worker_by_lua_block {
  prometheus = require("prometheus").init("prometheus_metrics", {sync_interval=3})
}
```

### prometheus:counter()

**syntax:** prometheus:counter(*name*, *description*, *label_names*)

Registers a counter. Should be called once for each counter from the
[init_worker_by_lua_block](
https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#init_worker_by_lua_block)
section.

* `name` is the name of the metric.
* `description` is the text description that will be presented to Prometheus
  along with the metric. Optional (pass `nil` if you still need to define
  label names).
* `label_names` is an array of label names for the metric. Optional.

[Naming section](https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/naming/) of Prometheus
documentation provides good guidelines on choosing metric and label names.

Returns a `counter` object that can later be incremented.

Example:
```nginx
init_worker_by_lua_block {
  prometheus = require("prometheus").init("prometheus_metrics")

  metric_bytes = prometheus:counter(
    "nginx_http_request_size_bytes", "Total size of incoming requests")
  metric_requests = prometheus:counter(
    "nginx_http_requests_total", "Number of HTTP requests", {"host", "status"})
}
```

### prometheus:gauge()

**syntax:** prometheus:gauge(*name*, *description*, *label_names*)

Registers a gauge. Should be called once for each gauge from the
[init_worker_by_lua_block](
https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#init_worker_by_lua_block)
section.

* `name` is the name of the metric.
* `description` is the text description that will be presented to Prometheus
  along with the metric. Optional (pass `nil` if you still need to define
  label names).
* `label_names` is an array of label names for the metric. Optional.

Returns a `gauge` object that can later be set.

Example:
```nginx
init_worker_by_lua_block {
  prometheus = require("prometheus").init("prometheus_metrics")

  metric_connections = prometheus:gauge(
    "nginx_http_connections", "Number of HTTP connections", {"state"})
}
```

### prometheus:histogram()

**syntax:** prometheus:histogram(*name*, *description*, *label_names*,
  *buckets*)

Registers a histogram. Should be called once for each histogram from the
[init_worker_by_lua_block](
https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#init_worker_by_lua_block)
section.

* `name` is the name of the metric.
* `description` is the text description. Optional.
* `label_names` is an array of label names for the metric. Optional.
* `buckets` is an array of numbers defining bucket boundaries. Optional,
  defaults to 20 latency buckets covering a range from 5ms to 10s (in seconds).

Returns a `histogram` object that can later be used to record samples.

Example:
```nginx
init_worker_by_lua_block {
  prometheus = require("prometheus").init("prometheus_metrics")

  metric_latency = prometheus:histogram(
    "nginx_http_request_duration_seconds", "HTTP request latency", {"host"})
  metric_response_sizes = prometheus:histogram(
    "nginx_http_response_size_bytes", "Size of HTTP responses", nil,
    {10,100,1000,10000,100000,1000000})
}
```

### prometheus:collect()

**syntax:** prometheus:collect()

Presents all metrics in a text format compatible with Prometheus. This should be
called in
[content_by_lua_block](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#content_by_lua_block)
to expose the metrics on a separate HTTP page.

Example:
```nginx
location /metrics {
  content_by_lua_block { prometheus:collect() }
  allow 192.168.0.0/16;
  deny all;
}
```

### prometheus:metric_data()

**syntax:** prometheus:metric_data()

Returns metric data as an array of strings.

### counter:inc()

**syntax:** counter:inc(*value*, *label_values*)

Increments a previously registered counter. This is usually called from
[log_by_lua_block](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#log_by_lua_block)
globally or per server/location.

* `value` is a value that should be added to the counter. Defaults to 1.
* `label_values` is an array of label values.

The number of label values should match the number of label names defined when
the counter was registered using `prometheus:counter()`. No label values should
be provided for counters with no labels. Non-printable characters will be
stripped from label values.

Example:
```nginx
log_by_lua_block {
  metric_bytes:inc(tonumber(ngx.var.request_length))
  metric_requests:inc(1, {ngx.var.server_name, ngx.var.status})
}
```

### counter:del()

**syntax:** counter:del(*label_values*)

Delete a previously registered counter. This is usually called when you don't
need to observe such counter (or a metric with specific label values in this
counter) any more. If this counter has labels, you have to pass `label_values`
to delete the specific metric of this counter. If you want to delete all the
metrics of a counter with labels, you should call `Counter:reset()`.

* `label_values` is an array of label values.

The number of label values should match the number of label names defined when
the counter was registered using `prometheus:counter()`. No label values should
be provided for counters with no labels. Non-printable characters will be
stripped from label values.

This function will wait for `sync_interval` before deleting the metric to
allow all workers to sync their counters.

### counter:reset()

**syntax:** counter:reset()

Delete all metrics for a previously registered counter. If this counter have no
labels, it is just the same as `Counter:del()` function. If this counter have labels,
it will delete all the metrics with different label values.

This function will wait for `sync_interval` before deleting the metrics to
allow all workers to sync their counters.

### gauge:set()

**syntax:** gauge:set(*value*, *label_values*)

Sets the current value of a previously registered gauge. This could be called
from [log_by_lua_block](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#log_by_lua_block)
globally or per server/location to modify a gauge on each request, or from
[content_by_lua_block](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#content_by_lua_block)
just before `prometheus::collect()` to return a real-time value.

* `value` is a value that the gauge should be set to. Required.
* `label_values` is an array of label values.

### gauge:inc()

**syntax:** gauge:inc(*value*, *label_values*)

Increments or decrements a previously registered gauge. This is usually called
when you want to observe the real-time value of a metric that can both be
increased and decreased.

* `value` is a value that should be added to the gauge. It could be a negative
value when you need to decrease the value of the gauge. Defaults to 1.
* `label_values` is an array of label values.

The number of label values should match the number of label names defined when
the gauge was registered using `prometheus:gauge()`. No label values should
be provided for gauges with no labels. Non-printable characters will be
stripped from label values.

### gauge:del()

**syntax:** gauge:del(*label_values*)

Delete a previously registered gauge. This is usually called when you don't
need to observe such gauge (or a metric with specific label values in this
gauge) any more. If this gauge has labels, you have to pass `label_values`
to delete the specific metric of this gauge. If you want to delete all the
metrics of a gauge with labels, you should call `Gauge:reset()`.

* `label_values` is an array of label values.

The number of label values should match the number of label names defined when
the gauge was registered using `prometheus:gauge()`. No label values should
be provided for gauges with no labels. Non-printable characters will be
stripped from label values.

### gauge:reset()

**syntax:** gauge:reset()

Delete all metrics for a previously registered gauge. If this gauge have no
labels, it is just the same as `Gauge:del()` function. If this gauge have labels,
it will delete all the metrics with different label values.

### histogram:observe()

**syntax:** histogram:observe(*value*, *label_values*)

Records a value in a previously registered histogram. Usually called from
[log_by_lua_block](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#log_by_lua_block)
globally or per server/location.

* `value` is a value that should be recorded. Required.
* `label_values` is an array of label values.

Example:
```nginx
log_by_lua_block {
  metric_latency:observe(tonumber(ngx.var.request_time), {ngx.var.server_name})
  metric_response_sizes:observe(tonumber(ngx.var.bytes_sent))
}
```

### histogram:reset()

**syntax:** histogram:reset()

Delete all metrics for a previously registered histogram.

This function will wait for `sync_interval` before deleting the metrics to
allow all workers to sync their counters.

### Built-in metrics

The module increments an error metric called `nginx_metric_errors_total`
(unless another name was configured in [init()](#init)) if it encounters
an error (for example, when `lua_shared_dict` becomes full). You might want
to configure an alert on that metric.

## Caveats

### Usage in stream module

For now, there is no way to share a dictionary between HTTP and Stream modules
in Nginx. If you are using this library to collect metrics from stream module,
you will need to configure a separate endpoint to return them. Here's an
example.

```nginx
server {
  listen 9145;
  content_by_lua_block {
    local sock = assert(ngx.req.socket(true))
    local data = sock:receive()
    local location = "GET /metrics"
    if string.sub(data, 1, string.len(location)) == location then
      ngx.say("HTTP/1.1 200 OK")
      ngx.say("Content-Type: text/plain")
      ngx.say("")
      ngx.say(table.concat(prometheus:metric_data(), ""))
    else
      ngx.say("HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found")
    end
  }
}
```

## Known issues

### libnginx-mod-http-lua broken in some Debian and Ubuntu versions

Note that recent stable versions of Debian and Ubuntu are known to package
`ngx_lua` version incompatible with the version of `nginx` shipped in the same
distro. This results in nginx process segfaulting when the lua module is used,
making it completely unusable. In such case nginx error logs will clearly
indicate that the process crashed, e.g.:

```
[alert] 123#123: worker process 45678 exited on signal 11
```

The following versions of Debian and Ubuntu have been known to have this
issue:

* Debian 11 (bug [#994178](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=994178))
* Ubuntu 20.04 and 21.04 (bug [#1893753](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nginx/+bug/1893753))

## Troubleshooting

### Make sure that nginx lua module is enabled

If you experience problems indicating that nginx doesn't know how to interpret
lua scripts, please make sure that [the lua
module](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module) is enabled. You might
need something like this in your `nginx.conf`:

```nginx
load_module modules/ndk_http_module.so;
load_module modules/ngx_http_lua_module.so;
```

### Keep lua code cache enabled

This module expects the
[lua_code_cache](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#lua_code_cache)
option to be `on` (which is the default).

### Try using an older version of the library

If you are seeing library initialization errors, followed by errors for each
metric change request (e.g. *attempt to index global '...' (a nil value)*),
you are probably using an old version of lua-nginx-module. For example, this
will happen if you try using the latest version of this library with the
`nginx-extras` package shipped with Ubuntu 16.04.

If you cannot upgrade nginx and lua-nginx-module, you can try using an older
version of this library; it will not have the latest performance optimizations,
but will still be functional. The recommended older release to use is
[0.20181120](https://github.com/knyar/nginx-lua-prometheus/tree/0.20181120).
